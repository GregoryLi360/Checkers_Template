## Checkers Game Template for learning Java

Your task is to edit the following files and create a working checkers game:
- Board.java 
- Pawn.java
- King.java 

The goal of this project is to just play around with Java as a language
and try to get accustomed to programming in Java, so don't worry if you 
don't finish the entire game! Try to understand the code, if there is anything that doesn't make sense, 
you can always send me a message and ask about it.

If you don't know where to start, start by running the code and seeing what 
the errors tell you to do. Also, read the comments in the files listed above
for further information.
